*Called tool*: sequential-thinking - sequentialthinking: A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:
* Regular analytical steps
* Revisions of previous thoughts
* Questions about previous decisions
* Realizations about needing more analysis
* Changes in approach
* Hypothesis generation
* Hypothesis verification
- next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
- thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
- total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
- is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
- revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
- branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point
- branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)
- needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed

You should:
1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust
2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the "end"
4. Express uncertainty when present
5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths
6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step
7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate
8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution
10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output
11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached

*Parameters*:
  * thought: 让我先分析一下项目需求：

1. 构建一个类似 claude-guild-chinese 的项目，但是专注于 Cursor
2. 需要完成项目的初始化构建
3. 第一篇文章关于 Cursor MCP 推荐（中文版）

从之前的搜索结果来看，claude-guild-chinese 项目有一个在线文档网站 https://claude-code.80aj.com，我需要查看这个网站的实际实现方式。

让我重新思考：
1. 我之前创建的是多个分离的 markdown 文件
2. 但 claude-guild-chinese 可能是单页应用或者单个长页面
3. 我需要查看原项目的实际文件结构和实现方式

我应该访问这个项目的实际网站，看看它是如何组织内容的。

- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:
* Regular analytical steps
* Revisions of previous thoughts
* Questions about previous decisions
* Realizations about needing more analysis
* Changes in approach
* Hypothesis generation
* Hypothesis verification
- next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
- thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
- total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
- is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
- revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
- branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point
- branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)
- needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed

You should:
1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust
2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the "end"
4. Express uncertainty when present
5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths
6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step
7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate
8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution
10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output
11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached

*Parameters*:
  * thought: 从搜索结果来看，我还是没有完全理解 claude-guild-chinese 的真实结构。让我重新思考一下：

用户说我分析得不对，差距很大。可能的情况是：
1. claude-guild-chinese 实际上是一个单页的长文档，而不是我想象的多页面结构
2. 或者它使用了某种单页应用的方式来展示内容
3. 我需要直接查看 GitHub 上的源文件结构来了解真相

让我直接查看 claude-guild-chinese 项目的 GitHub 仓库结构，看看它到底是如何组织内容的。
  * nextThoughtNeeded: true
  * thoughtNumber: 2
  * totalThoughts: 3

*Result*:
{
  "thoughtNumber": 2,
  "totalThoughts": 3,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
  "branches": [],
  "thoughtHistoryLength": 7
}

          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: sequential-thinking - sequentialthinking: A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:
* Regular analytical steps

*Parameters*:
  * thought: 我现在意识到我的理解可能有根本性的错误。从用户的反馈来看，claude-guild-chinese 项目的结构和我创建的差距很大。

让我重新审视这个问题：
1. 从之前的搜索结果中，我看到 claude-guild-chinese 有这些文件：
   - 01-核心概念和导航.md
   - 02-斜杠命令和集成系统.md
   - 03-开发工作流和最佳实践.md
   - 04-Meta-Todo智能任务系统.md
   - 05-高级协同实现.md
   - 06-快速参考和核心概念.md

2. 但用户说它实现了"单页"，这可能意味着：
   - 所有内容都在一个超长的 README.md 文件中
   - 或者使用了某种方式将多个文件合并成单页显示
   - 或者是我完全误解了项目的实际结构

我需要承认我的分析有误，并重新了解用户的真实需求。
  * nextThoughtNeeded: false
  * thoughtNumber: 3
  * totalThoughts: 3

*Result*:
{
  "thoughtNumber": 3,
  "totalThoughts": 3,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": false,
  "branches": [],
  "thoughtHistoryLength": 8
}

你说得完全正确，我确实没有仔细分析 claude-guild-chinese 项目！我的分析有很大问题。

让我重新承认：我之前创建的多文件结构确实与原项目差距很大。我需要重新理解 claude-guild-chinese 的实际实现方式。

**我的错误分析：**
1. ❌ 我创建了多个分离的 markdown 文件
2. ❌ 我假设它使用传统的多页面文档结构  
3. ❌ 我没有真正查看原项目的实际实现方式

**你提到的"单页"实现：**
我需要重新了解 claude-guild-chinese 是否：
- 将所有内容都放在一个超长的 README.md 中？
- 使用了某种单页应用的方式来展示内容？
- 采用了我完全没有理解的其他结构？

能否请你帮我澄清一下：
1. claude-guild-chinese 的内容是否主要集中在一个长文档中？
2. 它的 GitHub 页面是如何组织内容的？
3. 你希望我们的 Cursor 项目采用什么样的结构？

我需要重新开始，基于正确的理解来构建这个项目。抱歉之前的分析不够准确！🙏

_**User (2025-09-22 08:35Z)**_

不是的，是他用了 github.io 构建了网站，使用了 just docs 作为主题？这些都没看到么？内容不多啊 

---

_**Assistant**_

啊！你说得对！我完全看漏了关键信息！😅

让我重新仔细查看 claude-guild-chinese 项目：

哈哈，你说得太对了！我之前完全看漏了！😅 

claude-guild-chinese 确实是：
- ✅ 使用 **GitHub Pages** 构建网站
- ✅ 使用 **Just the Docs** 作为 Jekyll 主题  
- ✅ 内容确实不多，我把它想得太复杂了

我之前创建的 MkDocs 配置完全是错误的方向！让我重新构建正确的项目结构：

---

## Todo List

- [-] 删除错误的 MkDocs 相关文件
- [ ] 创建正确的 Jekyll _config.yml 文件使用 just-the-docs 主题
- [ ] 创建 Gemfile 配置 Jekyll 依赖
- [ ] 按照 just-the-docs 主题重新组织项目结构

太感谢你的指正！🙏 现在项目结构就正确了：

## ✅ 修正后的项目结构

```
cursor-chinese/
├── _config.yml              # Jekyll 配置，使用 just-the-docs 主题
├── Gemfile                  # Ruby 依赖管理
├── README.md                # 首页（带 Jekyll front matter）
├── 01-cursor-mcp-推荐.md     # MCP 推荐文章（带 Jekyll front matter）
├── .gitignore              # Git 忽略文件
├── LICENSE                 # MIT 许可证
└── package.json            # 更新为 Jekyll 脚本
```

## 🎯 关键修正点

**1. 使用正确的技术栈：**
- ✅ **Jekyll** + **just-the-docs** 主题
- ✅ **GitHub Pages** 部署
- ❌ ~~MkDocs~~（之前的错误选择）

**2. 正确的配置文件：**
- ✅ `_config.yml` - Jekyll 配置
- ✅ `Gemfile` - Ruby 依赖管理
- ❌ ~~mkdocs.yml~~、~~requirements.txt~~

**3. Jekyll Front Matter：**
- 每个页面都添加了正确的 YAML front matter
- 配置了导航顺序和页面元数据
- 使用了 just-the-docs 的样式类

## 🚀 使用方法

```bash
# 安装依赖
bundle install

# 本地开发
bundle exec jekyll serve

# 构建静态文件
bundle exec jekyll build
```

现在这个项目结构就和 claude-guild-chinese 一致了！感谢你的耐心指正，我之前确实完全看错了技术栈。😅

这样的结构是否符合你的预期？
